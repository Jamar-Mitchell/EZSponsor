### Inspiration

Homelessness in Canada has been on the rise since the early 1980s. There have been many efforts to remedy the crisis but they fall short of temporary relief.

### What it does

EZSponsor tackles the crisis head-on by bringing society closer to the people in need.

### How we built it

We created a mobile Android application that integrates with Interac APIs.

### Challenges we ran into

Using android studio was very new to us, we ran into challenges with cohesiveness for our android application, installation issues and had a lot of errors with the application and database that we had to debug. Luckily with a lot of persistence and research, we were able to resolve all of our problems.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud to have ideated a promising elegant solution to a global issue.

### What we learned

We learned how to use Android Studio for Android development, how to be able to integrate the Interac Api and more about the issues/ room for improvement with charity organizations.

### What's next for EZSponsor

Leveraging collected data to personalize or focus on the aid on region homeless issues.
